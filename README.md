# Sync time in Windows 10 automatically
Batch file that syncs the clock in Windows 10, along with a task in Task Scheduler to automate the process.

I had a unique issue with the time resetting on each boot. This is more for my personal reference, but anyone else with the same issue is free to use it. I have documented the issue on my blog - https://www.warrenrodrigues.com/blog/how-to-sync-time-in-windows-10-automatically/
